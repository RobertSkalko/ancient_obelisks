# Can I create my own maps?

Yes! All you need to do is create all the rooms, save them as structure blocks and list their names in the dungeon datapack json.
Though there are a lot of details involved

# How to create your own Dungeon Map?

TODO

For this you need to create an ancient_obelisks/ancient_obelisks_obelisk datapack
Note: I started using modid in folder names after bugs with other mods that used same folder names

You must create a json for your arena:
- copy an existing json from the mod jar
- make sure each type has at least 1 room
- Structure files must be max 16x[height]x16, height can be maximum possible



To actually spawn content in these maps, you need use command blocks with data 'tags' or ids.
Basically the Mod detects the text inside command blocks in the Dungeon Realm, and spawns content accordingly when a player is nearby.
For example, the most common id: 'mob' spawns about 1-2 random mobs at the location.

TODO auto gen these.


That's it, have fun creating custom Dungeon Maps!
